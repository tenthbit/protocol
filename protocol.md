# Tenthbit Protocol

## About
The tenthbit protocol is a JSON-based communications protocol that offers the following advantages over IRC:

- Required SSL for client connections and intra-server linking, ensuring that a valid network doesn't put bare data on the wire, though there are no guarantees
- Optional GZip compression when supported and beneficial, e.g. between server nodes
- Federated, decentralized authentication between independant servers, and possibly more later on
- A baked-in account system and access-control list (ACL) for channels, distributed across nodes for reliability
- Support for meshed links between server nodes, reducing impact of a node failure, provided by unique identifiers attached to every packet

## Communications
Communications on a server are organized in to topics, much like channels on an IRC network. Topics are identified by UUIDs and by names; thus, topic names can be changed at any point. Each topic stores an ACL which determines who is authorized to complete certain actions. In addition, topics have a list of key/value pairs storing metadata such as the topic's name, a description, message format, and really anything else.

### Message formats
A message format dictates how a client should encode and parse formatting into a topic's messages. Official formats are:
* `plain`: plain utf-8 text. No formatting should be done. Clients may use a variable-width font when displaying text.
* `fixed`: fixed-width utf-8 text. Like `plain`, except should be shown with a fixed-width font.
* `markdown`: utf-8 text, formatted using markdown. This will probably be default and should probably be used in discussion channels.
* `html`: utf-8 html text, marked up using a subset of html tags - to be clarified
* `irc`: ansi text like what would be used with an IRC server. Should be shown in a fixed-width font, and may contain mIRC-style formatting and color codes, which clients may or may not honor (but must at least strip if offering this format).
* `binary`: raw binary octets. Note that this is not particularly efficient, as the binary string will be encoded in JSON.

Third-parties may invent custom formats. When doing so, starting with an above format name and appending a colon and then a proprietary name allows nonsupporting clients to use the mentioned base format to at least somewhat understand what's going on; for example, `fixed:ascii-art`. Otherwise, clients should assume `plain` as the base format.

### Access control list
TODO

## Federation
At the moment, only the account system is federated (communications may be federated later). Essentially, an account that exists on one server (the account's "home" server) can be used to authenticate against other servers (servers which are "foreign" to that account). Once authentication succeeds, foreign servers are not required to fully authorize the nonlocal user as a local user.

Accounts are specified using an email-style notation; a user `danopia` on a server located at `10b.it` would be globally addressable by `danopia@10b.it`. However, other users accessing the `10b.it` server may refer to the same user with simply `danopia`. Bare usernames act the same as usernames with the current server's name appended.

### Foreign authentication flow
A ticket-based system is used to prevent credentials from flowing through potentially untrusted foreign servers. An alphanumeric ticket is generated by an account's home server via an established connection as per the user's request at any time, and must expire at some point in the future. [TODO: Pair a ticket with a certain remote server, and only let it work when presented by that certain server.]

A valid ticket may be presented to a foreign server during the authentication flow, along with the ticket's home server. For example, `danopia@10b.it` received the ticket `OHMY`. `danopia` may connect to `somewhere.else` and request authentication with `{ticket: "OHMY", server: "10b.it"}`. `somewhere.else` SHOULD connect to `10b.it` (if not already connected) and relay the ticket. `10b.it` must reply with the corresponding username (in this case, `danopia`) if the ticket was valid, or an error otherwise. If the ticket existed, `10b.it` MUST invalidate it so that further redemption attempts with the same ticket will fail.

## Wire protocol
The 10bit protocol is JSON-based, and transported via a TLS connection to **TCP port `10317`**. Every packet is serialized into a JSON representation, which is then sent over the SSL socket, terminated with a UNIX newline (`"\n"`). After the other party receives the packet and decrypts it, it can parse the JSON into whatever internal representation it likes most.

The SSL transport is basic for now, though SSL keys may later be used to authorize clients to their account. When available, the protocol should be advertised by the server as `10bit/0.1` (via NPN or ALPN). A gzip transport may be enabled between SSL and the JSON by negotiating a `10bit-gzip/0.1` protocol through NPN/ALPN. A server MAY choose to accept the gzip request when available and allowed.

Servers may also take advantage of the NPN/ALPN mechanism by offering an HTTP and/or SPDY transport. When combined with CORS, this allows for a clean webchat implementation. Consider that CORS may require handling an OPTIONS request in addition to the websocket's UPGRADE request.

### JSON payload
Most packets have a similar base structure, consisting of:
* `id`: ID; key containing a unique ID for the *action* which caused the packet. Useful for mesh linking and some context perks
* `ts`: timestamp; UNIX timestamp for when the packet was first received/processed through a server node, in milliseconds
* `tp`: topic; Unique ID identifying the topic that this payload is in reference to. Not present if not applicable
* `op`: operation; Common `op`s are `ack`, `error`, `auth`, `find`, `act`, `join`, `leave`, and `meta`
* `sr`: source; origin of the action. May be a username (`danopia`), server (`@10b.it`), or federated user (`danopia@10b.it`).
* `ex`: extra; `op`-specific data, in an object

### Operations
* `welcome`: Sent by the server to initiate the connection. Contains limited server metadata, and more importantly, an array of supported authentication methods in the `auth` extra.
* `auth`: Any authentication-related packet, other than the final `ack` or `error`. More details TODO. Official methods may include `password`, `ticket`, `anonymous`, `twostep`, and `ssl`.
* `ack`: Every packet sent by the client needs to have some sort of response. If there isn't one, an `ack` is sent instead. `ack`s specify what `op` they are for in the `for` extra.
* `meta`: Used to transfer metadata, which is basically any data. Servers, clients, and topics all have metadata. At the moment, this `op` is only able to dump all metadata, which is stored directly in `ex`.
* `error`: Attempts to convey some sort of protocol failure. May be followed by a dropped connection. TODO
* `join`: Conveys that a user has been added to a topic's userlist. The user in question is named in the `user` extra. This may or may not be merged in to `meta` at some point.
* `leave`: Like `join`, except that the user has been removed.
* `find`: Searches for objects (users, topics) by metadata. TODO
* `act`: Topic activity. Such activity is usually transient to the server. Activity has a `type` extra. Some common types:
    * `msg`: Most common type. Used to mean a normal message has been sent, and is in the `data` extra. May refer to a previous message by ID using the `context` extra.
    * `action`: Like `msg`, except displayed like IRC `/me`, that is, prefixed with the sender's username.
    * `state`: May be used to convey typing state. Should only be used in smaller channels or otherwise when indicated by some channel flag. The `typing` extra would be `true` or `false`, and the `hastext` extra would also be boolean (as in, text has been entered, but the user is not actively adding to it). If either is absent, they're assumed false.
    * `revise`: Like `msg`, has `data` and `context`; however, instead of replying to a message, `revise` requests to replace the older message's data. If a client decides to honor the revision (using criteria such as being by the same user and a certain timeframe ago), it should visually convey that the message was modified, with some way to view past revisions.

### Example Welcome flow
    <-> ssl handshake, negotiation for protocol 10bit/0.1
    <-- server sends op=welcome, ex={server: "10b.it", software: "10bit reference server/0.0.1", now: 1373552037052, auth: ["password", "ticket", "anonymous"]}
    --> client sends op=auth, ex={method: "password", username: "danopia", password: "hellosecret"}
    <-- op=ack, ex={for: "auth"}
    <-- op=meta, sr="@10b.it", ex={...} # includes server metadata, like rules
    <-- op=meta, sr="danopia", ex={...} # includes own metadata, like favorite topics and fullname
    <-- op=meta, sr="@10b.it", tp="asdfasdf", ex={...} # topic metadata, also includes self in nicklist, since autojoined
